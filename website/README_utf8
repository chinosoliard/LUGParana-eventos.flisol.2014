##############################
1. ABOUT 
##############################

FliSys is a Web-based open source system that allows 
regional teams of FLISOL to manage the event with
ease and efficiency.

The FliSys can also be used to manage other events
with registered visitors, lectures and workshops.

FliSys is free software and its license
(contained in the file COPYING) is provided under the GPL.

##############################
2. QUICK START
##############################

To start using FliSys, first you must fill in the file
configuration data with the server that the system is applied
and the same database. The file can be found at:

/includes/configure.php

(a more detailed explanation of the fields to be filled is below)

After you fill out the information server and database
you must run Setup to create and populate the tables
will be used by FliSys. The installation file can be found at:

http://youdomain/flisys/install.php

To update v0.3.3-RC1 to the final version:

http://youdomain/flisys/update.php

For more information and troubleshooting, read the rest of this
file and the documentation files (see "DOCUMENTATION"). Other
informations and questions can be consulted on the project page at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/flisys

##############################
3. REQUIREMENTS
##############################

The FliSys runs on most existing web servers, including
servers for internal use, simply have the following items:

	Apache (2 or newer)
	ADOdb library
	Database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc)
	PHP (4 or newer)

##############################
4. CONFIGURATION
##############################

The configuration file used by FliSys can be found at:

/includes/configure.php

We will see below the file in details:

The first option is to set the event information:

__NOME				- Event Name to be used by FliSys
__COORD_NAME		- Name of Event Coordinator
__COORD_EMAIL		- E-Mail Coordinator
__LOCAL_NAME		- Name of the place where the event will be held
__FESTIVAL_DATE		- Event Date
__LOCAL_LOGOTYPE	- The name of the file containing the logo of the event

The next option is to set the language to be used by FliSys.
At the moment only the Brazil Portuguese (pt_br) and Spanish Latim America
(sp_la) are available.

LANG_USED	- to determine the language to be used

Then comes the configuration of your database:

__DB			- Driver to be used to connect to the DB
__DB_HOST		- The host where the DB
__DB_DATABASE	- Database to be used to create FliSys tables
__DB_USER		- User database with r/w permissions
__DB_PWD		- User Password
__ADODB_PATH	- Absolute path of where to find the ADOdb library
__ADODB_DEBUG	- Use true / false to enable or disable debug mode (Test only) 

The tables to be used by FliSys should not be created manually,
because the system will delete them and (re) create them again with the
necessary information, so just enter the desired names
system to create them and use them. It is recommended that the table names
start with the name of the system to facilitate the identification of
same, for example: flisys_users.

__TB_USERS		- Table of visitor data
__TB_OPS		- Table of operators data
__TB_LECTURES	- Table of lectures data
__TB_WORKSHOP	- Table of workshops data
__TB_STATE		- Table containing the states
__TB_TPLOGRA	- Table containing the types of parks (eg Street, Avenue)
__TB_CITIES		- Table containing the cities (only Brazil at the moment)
__TB_COUNTRIES	- Table of countries
__TB_CORBUS		- Table containing the following trades
__TB_KNOW		- Table with options for the field "How did you known?"
__TB_FS			- Table with a list of free softwares available to deploy
__TB_ARCH		- Table containing the architecture of the free softwares available
__TB_CERTS		- Table containing the text of Certificates

After finishing the settings of the database, followed by informing the
regional preferences, such as the state, the city where the event is
being held, the country and type of street to be used as default:

__DEFAULT_STATE		- Default States
__DEFAULT_CITY		- Default City
__DEFAULT_COUNTRY	- Default Country
__DEFAULT_TP_LOGRA	- Default Park Type

This area is a little customization to meet the
FLISOL regions where it is performed. Given that visitors are not
necessarily the region where the event is being held, so the
system has a large database of cities and countries. Later,
we wil add all the cities of the participating countries
in FLISOL (anyone who can help with this step, please contact us).

Now you should inform the field where being FliSys
executed for the correct functioning of the pages, such as
http://www.yourdomain.org/flisys/:

PG_HOME		- Domain (site) where FliSys is hosted

And by the end, the temporary directory with RW access to the system to generate
temporary files to upload data and statistics.

__TEMP_DIR	- Temporary directory with r/w permission

The rest of the settings file is not needed
changes unless they really need or want to change your
operation.

#############################
5. INSTALLATION
#############################

After entering the configuration information it is time to perform
FliSys installation. This installation basically consists of creating and
populate the tables in the database with the necessary information
for the proper functioning of the system, so make a back-up
Table of visitors since all existing tables are excluded and
re-created for inclusion of new data.

IMPORTANT: It is highly recommended to perform a
backup of existing data, in case you own a previous version of
FliSys installed.

Made the recommendations, go to "http://www.yourdomain.org/install.php" to
begin installing the system.

The first step is to display the installer to verify that the
information had been filled correctly, if everything is ok,
press the Continue button.

Then the installer will destroy the existing tables and (re) create
new tables by entering new information for the system operation.

NOTE: Depending on the machine on which the system is
executed the creation and insertion of data in the tables can take on
average of 3 to 8 minutes. Mainly in the inclusion of cities
Brazil, the rest should flow smoothly.

#############################
6. POST-INSTALLATION
#############################

When installation is complete, remove the following files to prevent
errors or accidents:

- install.php
- install_step2.php
- install_finish.php
- install_brazilian_cities.php
- install_countries.php
- update.php
- update_finish.php

##############################
7. RUNNING
##############################

Finally, now it's time to start using FliSys. Go to the homepage
of the system (PG_HOME) and perform authentication to start.

By default, FliSys creates a user with full access level.

User: admin
Password: admin
Access Level: Advanced

IMPORTANT: For your safety, after performing the first login,
change the default user's password or delete it after you
insert another operator with full access level (Advanced).

###############################
8. DOCUMENTATION
###############################

The FliSys does not have extensive documentation, help us by sending
tutorials, FAQs, HOWTOs and other documents that could help more
FliSys users.
